### Association rule mining
[[large item set]]
[[support]]
x [[frequent itemset]] of size y
[[confidence]] of an association rule
[[interesting association rule]]
[[naive approach]]
[[2-step approach]]
[[lift ratio]]
as step 1 is more complicated than step 2 when the data amount is large, 2 algorithms are used:
[[Apriori approach]]
[[FP growth approach]]
