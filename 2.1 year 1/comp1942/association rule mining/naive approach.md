### naive approach
1. enumerate all possible association rule
2. find all the support and confident of each rule
3. find all rule with [[confidence]] and [[support]] larger than a certain threshold

let the result of this approach is $S_0$ and the result of the [[2-step approach]] is $S_2$

[[proof of S_0=S_2]]
