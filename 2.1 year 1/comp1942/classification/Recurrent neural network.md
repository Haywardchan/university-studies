we want to capture the dependency of the previous record on the current record, thus [[Recurrent neural network]] is introduced.

limitations of RNN:
1. compared with traditional neural networks, it may 'memorize' a lot of past events/values.
2. it is more time-consuming for training due to its complex structure.

In [[Recurrent neural network]], it is divided into the [[basic RNN]], [[traditional LSTM]], and [[GRU]].

there is also [[multi-layer RNN]], which is like [[multi-layer perceptron]] used for solving more complicated questions.
