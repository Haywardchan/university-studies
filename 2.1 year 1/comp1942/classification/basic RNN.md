- simple
- only contains one activation function (e.g. [[tanh function]] and [[Rectifier function_Retified Linear Unit_ReLU]])

Disadvantages:
1. the model is too simple
2. it could not simulate our human brain too much
3. not easy for the basic RNN model to converge thus requires a large training time

the other two different RNN models, [[traditional LSTM]] and [[GRU]] are more complicated, containing not only the activation functions, but also other functions such as [[forget feature]], [[input feature]], and [[output feature]].
