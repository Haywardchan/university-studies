information gain of attribute A on target attribute T of ID3:
$$Gain(A,T)=Info(T)-Info(A,T)$$
In C4.5, an attribute containing more values will be penalized with splitinfo(A,T), which is give by the following:
$$SplitInfo(A)=-\sum_{v\in A}p(v)logp(v)$$
the information gain after penalization in C4.5:
$$Gain(A,T)=\frac{Info(T)-Info(A,T)}{SplitInfo(A)}$$
