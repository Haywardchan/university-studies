[[Bayes Rule]] is derived from [[Conditional Probability]].
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)}$$
[[Independent assumption]] is made such that multiple criteria can be created in one probability.
$$P(X,Y,Z|A)=P(X|A)\times P(Y|A)\times P(Z|A)$$

However, in [[Bayesian Belief Network]], we do not have [[Independent assumption]].
