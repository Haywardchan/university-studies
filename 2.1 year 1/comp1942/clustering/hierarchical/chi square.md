### chi square
$$x_{ab}^2=\frac{(ad-bc)^2N}{(a+b)(a+c)(b+d)(c+d)}$$
the higher the value of $x_{ab}^2$, the higher the correlation of A, B
thus the points are closer.

we can divide the attributes and see which is the largest:
$$I.e.for \space attribute\space A:x^2_{AB}+x^2_{AC}=4.09...etc$$
we split the attribute with the largest value into 2 different clusters.
