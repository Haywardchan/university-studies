the group of file handling tools is put in a package called **java.io** and the group of networking tools is put in a package called **java.net**.

Since the _File_ tool is one of file handling tools you need to get the tool from the package **java.io**. To do that you need to _import_ the package at the top of your source file, using this line of code:
```java
import java.io.*;
```
As you may know, * sometimes means 'everything' in the programming world.

 if you only want to use **File** from the **java.io** package, the following code helps you import **File** from the package.
 ```java
import java.io.File;
```
$$import\space package.file$$
