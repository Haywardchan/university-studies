### comparison test
by the [[comparison theorem]],
suppose that $f(x)>=g(x)>=0$ and $x>=a$ then
>1. if $\int_{a}^{\infty}f(x)dx$ is convergent, then $\int_{a}^{\infty}g(x)dx$ is convergent
>2. if $\int_{a}^{\infty}g(x)dx$ is divergent, then $\int_{a}^{\infty}f(x)dx$ is divergent

by further deriving, 
suppose that $a_n>=b_n>=0$ for all n then
>1. if $\sum a_n$ is convergent, then $\sum b_n$ is convergent
>2. if $\sum b_n$ is divergent, then $\sum a_n$ is divergent

the comparing target should be the dominant variable in both the denomenator and the numerator.

the [[limit comparison test]] can be used if the comparison test cannot be used in situations that factorials exist.
