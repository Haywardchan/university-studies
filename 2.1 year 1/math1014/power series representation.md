> for $|r|<1$ :$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n =\frac{a}{1-r}$$ it converges.

write the function into the form of $\frac{a}{1-r}$
the parathesis of a power series is always () open interval.

for an alternating series, use even number of terms to estimate the answer else it would be a bit off.
$\sum_{n=0}^\infty C_n(x-a)^n$
should be the form after transforming the function into a power series

when the function is in the form of $\frac{a}{a-r}$ then we can divide both denominator and numerator by a such that it is in form of $\frac{a}{1-r}$

for functions in form of $\frac{x^a}{x+a}$, separate the function into 2 parts and do the deviation.

partial fraction composition have to be done for $\frac{a}{ax^2+bx+c}$, then calculate it by separating them into 2 calculations. The [[interval of convergence]] of the series is the intersection $\cap$ of 2 different [[interval of convergence]].
