## Classifying Sequences
from [[Sequences and Series]]

e.g. [[Geometric Sequences]]
**- Bounded Sequences**
	- Bounded from above (has max value, least upper bound)
	- Bounded from below (hax min value, greatest lower bound)
**- Monotonic Sequences**
	- Nondecreasing
	- Nonincreasing
- Diverging Sequences
	- to inf / neg inf
- Oscillating Sequences

> **Bounded Monotonic Sequence Theorem**
> monotonic + bounded -> converge

### Proving Convergence
1. Directly computing limits
2. Sandwich Theorem
3. Mathematical Induction
4. (Proving Monotonicity) $f(n)=a_n$ -> find sign of $f'(x)$

### Growth Rate of Sequences
- L'Hospital's Rule relates the growth rate of sequences to their limits
