## Bounded sequence
If there is a number **M** such that 
>$a_n<=M$ **for all** $n>=1$

We call {$a_n$} is bounded above 

if there is a number **m** such that
>$m<=a_n$ **for all** $n>=1$ 

We call {$a_n$} is bounded below

If {$a_n$} is bounded below and above then {$a_n$} is a **bounded sequence**

the bounded sequence can be investigated by the [[mathematical induction]] like [[monotonic sequence]].
