An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative.

If the alternating series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}b_n$ satisfies
>1. $b_{n+1}\leq b_n$
>2. $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = 0$

we can test the first derivative for checking whether the function is decreasing.

[[Alternating Series Estimation Theorem]] for [[remainder estimation]]
If $S=\sum (-1)^{n-1}b_n$ is the sum of an alternating series that satisfies
>1. $b_{n+1}\leq b_n$
>2. $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = 0$

then $|R_n|=|S-S_n| \leq b_{n+1}$
