# infinite sequence
**notation:{$a_n$}

> $\lim_{x \to +\infty} a_n = L$


A sequence is a [[monotonic sequence]] if it is either increasing or decreasing.
A sequence is a [[bounded sequence]] if there is a boundary of the value of the sequence. 
[[monotonic sequence theorem]] applies if the sequence is both monotonic and bounded.
[[squeeze theorem]] for sequences shows that sequences are like functions which have its own convergence.

[[2.1 year 1/math1014/Infinite Series]] is the summation of a sequence denoted by $\sum a_n$
partial sum $S_n$ denoted by $\sum\limits_{i=1}^na_n$
!!!Sequence$\neq$Series
If $\lim_{n \to +\infty}S_n = S$ exist as a real number, then we call $\sum a_n$ is convergent
elif $\lim_{n \to +\infty}S_n=DNE/\infty$, then we call $\sum a_n$ is divergent

when $\sum a_n$ is convergent, it implies that the partial sum of the [[2.1 year 1/math1014/Infinite Series]] exist and $\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=0$
