#### Check if 3 points are collinear
Determine whether or not the following points P(1 , −2 , 3) , Q(2 , 1 , 0) and R(4 ,7 , −6) are collinear.
-They are collinear when and only when they lie on the same straight line when and only when PR//PQ when and only when there exists a scalar k such that  PQ=kPR

##### find the angle between 2 vectors
$$cos\theta=\frac{\vec a\cdot \vec b}{|\vec a||\vec b|}$$
#### Orthogonal projection
$$proj_vu=comp_vu\times\hat v=|\vec u|cos\theta\frac{\vec v}{|\vec v|}=\frac{\vec u \cdot \vec v}{|\vec v|^2}\vec v$$
$$comp_vu=|\vec u|cos\theta=\frac{\vec u \cdot \vec v}{|\vec v|}$$
Suppose that a boat has 600 pounds (see the right figure). Express the force that pulls the boat down the ramp as a vector. Assume that the force is a 2-dimensional force having two components only. Besides, assume that the truck is motionless.
