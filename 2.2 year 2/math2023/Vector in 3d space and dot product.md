#### Check if 3 points are collinear
Determine whether or not the following points P(1 , −2 , 3) , Q(2 , 1 , 0) and R(4 ,7 , −6) are collinear.
-They are collinear when and only when they lie on the same straight line when and only when PR//PQ when and only when there exists a scalar k such that  PQ=kPR
