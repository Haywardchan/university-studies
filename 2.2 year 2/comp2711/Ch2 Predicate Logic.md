### Predicate logic/ first order logic
No propositional logic is used to conclude concepts like every/ exists
#### Predicates 
**predicate** is a statement that may be true or false depending on the choice of values of its variables. Each choice of values produces a proposition.
- function P() is called an n-ary predicate
I.e
- P(x) denotes the statement “x is greater than 3”. x is the variable, and P is the predicate “is greater than 3”
- Let P(x)=“x>3”. What are the truth values of P(4) and P(2)? 
-  Let A(x) = “student x is required to take either COMP 2711 or COMP 2711H”. Suppose Alice is a COMP student and Bob is a CHEM student. What are the truth values of A(Alice) and A(Bob)? 
-  Let Q(x, y) = “x=y+3”. What are the truth values of the propositions Q(1, 2) and Q(3, 0)?
#### Quantifiers 
##### Universal Quantification $\forall$
universal quantification of P(x) is the statement “for all elements x in the domain such that P(x)”
$∀x \space P(x)$: for all x P(x)
An false element is a counter example of $\forall x\space P(x)$
**Domain/ Universe**
domain or universe is the set of all possible values of a variable.
It should be specified when an universal quantifier is used, else the statement is not well-defined
assumption: the domain is not empty
