### comparing costs and benefits using data
#### present value costs
- maintainence cost
- construction cost
- increase in labor
- land purchase

#### present value benefits
- increased sales
- increased profit/margins
- greater volume discounts

use the marginal concepts
Benefits > Costs (Cash Today)

#### Valuation principle
maximize the utility/ value
1. Identifying the costs and benefits
2. Quantify the costs and benefits in equivalence terms
	- determine cash values using market prices
	- convert them into a common unit--today's cash
3. compare the quantified costs and benefits
	- accept if the benefits exceeds the costs

Problem:
 You are the operations manager at your firm. Due to a pre-existing contract, you have the opportunity to acquire 500 barrels of oil and 4,000 pounds of copper for a total of $50,000. The current market price of oil is $75 per barrel and for copper is $2.5 per pound. You are not sure that you need all of the oil and copper, so you are wondering if you should you take this opportunity. 
1. How valuable is the contract?
2. Would your decision change if you believe the value of oil or copper would increase over the next month?

Plan:
##### costs=$50000
(500 barrels) × ($75/barrel today) = $37,500 today 
(4,000 pounds of copper) × ($2.50/pound today) = $10,000 today 
##### Benefits = $37,500 + $10,000 = $47,500
Value of the opportunity=$-2500

2. No. Our decision will not change.  Our own use for or opinion about the future prospects of oil or copper do not alter the value of the decision today.  The value is determined by the market prices.  *We can simply buy the oil or copper at the market prices instead of using the contract.*

##### Law of One Price and Arbitrage Opportunity
hedge funds (Arbitrage)
Arbitrage 
 The practice of buying and selling equivalent goods in different markets to take advantage of a price difference.
Arbitrage opportunity 
 Chance to make a profit without taking any risk or any position in an investment.
Law of One Price 
 Intense competition will eliminate all arbitrage profits. Securities that produce exactly the same cash flows must have the same price. 
 If equivalent investment opportunities trade simultaneously in different competitive markets, then they must trade for the same price in both markets.

there is no arbitrage opportunities under the law of one price

**Interest rate** is an exchange rate across time 
• The rate at which we can convert cash today to cash in the future 
• It is commonly called the discount rate, required rate of return, opportunity cost of capital, cost of capital, or hurdle rate. 

 Suppose the current annual interest rate offered by the bank is 10%. By depositing or borrowing at this rate, we can exchange $1.10 in one year for each $1 today.

lending rate == deposit interest rate
