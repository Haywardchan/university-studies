You will write a proposal report for an innovation as an entry to the scenario of TechVention, an annual student inventors’ competition that aims to nurture creativity and imagination. 
The report should include the following:
-  An introduction
- A literature review, in which you review similar designs and establish the need for your innovation
- A detailed description of your idea
- A discussion of the feasibility and benefits of developing your innovation
- A conclusion

Name of your invention/technology: Smart recycling system  
Problems or needs that your invention addresses:  
-   huge pressure in landfills 
-   recycling bins only collect single type of material so it is time-consuming to do the classification 
-   materials in recycle bins need further sorting and cleansing which is costly and made recycling in Hong Kong not sufficiently prevalent 

Existing technologies (highlight their shortcomings in meeting the needs you identified):  
smart recycling program launched by the government  
-   the density of collection point is low, users cannot easily approach those recycling facilities, leading to the low participation rate 
-   people need to separate them one by one, which cause users refuse to do that owing to troublesome 
The advantage your innovation has over other existing technologies:
Social:  
-   More convenient as the machine can classify automatically with high accuracy 
-   enhancement of citizens’ motivation with the reward system 
Cost:  
-   Save labor cost for separating recyclable waste 
Technical: 
-   Existing technology (AI camera, compressor and sensors) 
-   Waste data scanned by the camera can be collected and stored in the Cloud for analysis 
Description of your innovation: a
ppearance (materials, shape, size), major functions, how it works (technology employed, etc.)  
Material: Stainless steel  
Size: 3m*1m*2m
Types of recyclable waste: paper, plastic, glass, cans 
Technology: 
1. Classification (using dynamic motion cameras (AI camera (deep learning/computer vision)) 
2. Cleaning bottles  
3. Compression (hydraulic pressure)
