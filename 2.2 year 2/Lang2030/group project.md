You will work in groups to deliver a **presentation** and lead a **seminar** on a real-life ethical case that involves one or more aspects of engineering ethics.

You should:

-   Give a brief outline of the details of the case; and (8mins)
-   Discuss the ethical issues that arise from the case. (8mins)

Two days before the presentation, the group will prepare 10 questions for use in the seminar and submit them to this assignment. (Each group will only need to make one submission.)

Canterbury TV Building Collapse

[](https://www.youtube.com/ "YouTube")Outline

1986 building designing[1.2]

22 February 2011 Canterbury TV building collapsed in an earthquake[1.1]

2012 a Royal Commission of Inquiry found serious errors by engineers, structural designers and the Christchurch City Council[1.2]

14 July 2014 Disciplinary Committee[2]

1 July 2016 Code of Ethical Conduct of New Zealand

Causalities/Consequences

-       Causing 115 deaths[1.1]

-       the structural design of the building was seriously deficient in multiple ways[2]

Stakeholders

-       Alan Reay

1.     Failed to disclose his involvement in the design and construction of the CTV building [1.1]

2.     Giving inexperience David Herding had “sole responsibility” for building mid-1980s design[1.1]

3.     Not reviewing his designer’s final report[1.1]

4.     Undefined role in the design of the CTV building[1.1]

-       David Harding

1.     Inexperience structural engineer[1.1]à not experienced in the analysis, design and construction of multi-storey structures [2]à rejoined to gain experiment in this area of work[2]

2.     Working beyond his limit when designing the building in 1986[1.2]<- lack of supervision of Alan Reay

3.     Professional Member of IPENZ at the time of his involvement in the design and construction of the CTV building [2]

4.     continued to be a member when the complaints were made in late 2012 but subsequently resigned his Membership of IPENZ in July 2014.[2]

5.     Employed by Alan Reay Consulting Engineers (ARCE) [2]

6.     No evidence of the final design documents that he had signed and submitted to the Christchurch City Council for building permit approval[2]

7.     Had breached the IPENZ Code of Ethics published in February 1986 current at the time he completed the design of the CTV building.[2]

8.     met the ethical requirement to disclose the limits of his competence but by signing and submitting the design documentation for the CTV building to the Christchurch City Council, Mr Harding effectively misrepresented his competence[2]

9.     Mr Harding’s resignation effectively removed its ability to discipline Mr Harding under the IPENZ Rules[2]à  the Disciplinary Committee no longer had power to make any orders against him, because he was no longer an IPENZ Member[2]

10. Principal engineer of building[5]

11. Lie to public that earthquake is the main cause of collapse[5]

12. Work on the CTV project in March 1986

13.  

-       Ipenz

1.     changed its rules so that members will not be able to avoid its disciplinary processes by resigning their membership in the future.[3]à making to our complaints process to ensure it is robust, transparent and fair,

Cause

1.     Technical

-       the structural design of the building was seriously deficient in multiple ways[2]

2.     Regulatory

3.     Organizational

Ethical problems

-       Policy flawed: the decision to drop the probe was flawed[1.1]à IPENZ&ACENZ should undertake a comprehensive review of Practice Note 14- _Structural Engineering Design Office Practice_ published in August 200

-       Reviewing the specific engineering activities: public interest are requiredà responsible engineer was a Chartered Professional Engineer[2]

-       Management of small engineering design consultancies àdeveloping guidelines?(e.g. design review, the supervision and mentoring of staff in structural engineering)[2]

-       Government: strengthen the regulation of engineers to "ensure they have the right knowledge, skills and competence" to design safe buildings and to hold them more accountable for substandard work[1.1]

-       **LACK OF INTEGRITY[5]**

Code breached

-        this breach constituted grounds for discipline under Rule 11 of the IPENZ Rules. [2]

-       Publication could be considered as a sanction[2]àPolicy:  guidance be given in respect of acceptable practices for small design firms and sole practitioners, expanding significantly [2](public awareness)[2]

Recommendations

-        engineer became aware of any concerns, including potential design flaws in a building under construction, or poor construction practices that threaten health and safety, they should report it[3]

IPENZ Code

The new code, which covers Chartered Professional Engineers and all members of Ipenz, which includes professional engineers, technologists and technicians, also makes explicit engineers' obligation to keep their knowledge and skills up to date, and to treat others with respect and courtesy.
