Applications of Text Classification
Naive Bayes Classifier
- Assumptions (Bags of Words, Conditional Independence)
- Formula (Normal, Add 1)
Binarize the document and count the frequency: Normalize the occurance
Precision, Recall, F score (2PR/P+R)
micro and macroaveraging of precision recall and f1 score
Paired bootstrap and statistical testing
model cards
Relations between sense: Synonymy, Antonymy, Similarity, Relatedness, Connotation (Valence, Arousal, Dominance)
Embeddings (tfidf, word2vec) cosine similarity
tfidf
- formula tf * idf, log(count+1)/log(N/df)
PMI
- formula log2(P(x,y)/P(x)P(y))
- PPMI max(PMI, 0)
- Weighted PMI raise P(c) to alpha in P(c) formula
Short dense vector
- Why
Distributed Representation 
- formula
- negative log likelihood
